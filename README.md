- 👋 Hi, I’m @Megawatt-Man- that means I am an electreic power engineer, retired but still learning, these days mainly microwatt issues. I am 80 years old and not really interested in coding - not enough time in my life to absorb it in sufficiency for my current desires! I can't understand most of what is on your site. In 1964 I learned and applied Fortran IV programming to some electrical engineering projects and tutored in it for a couple of years. I have used python just a little, didn't go far, bnecause it is too text oriented for me. 
- 👀 I’m interested in decoding some 433 MHz transmissions mainly for fun. I want to do this in Windows 10 and have downloaded rtl_433 64 bit etc. when I attempt to run it, the command screen pns ad immediately closes. I discovered that I could fool it by double=clicking but holding the mouse key down on the second click. It opens and reports detecting 30 to 50 protaocols and lists what device ar3 transmitting them BUt there are no decoded mesdsages, just the list of protocols. 
I have checked the security detailsd, always run as adminstrator. I have placed the app on the C drive with the same result. NO other exe files on my machine open and immediately close. I have downloaded rti_fm_player, it opens as expected. but tells me I have to fix the device permissions.  I run SDR# with no problems.
When I examine the unzipped package, I don't seem to have enough files, an imprerssion I get from looking at the results of all the downloading and building successful inmstallations. What do you reckon please? Best REgards, Warwick Nichols
